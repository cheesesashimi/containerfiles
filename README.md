# containers

This repository contains Containerfiles for all of the containers that I regularly use and / or want to have rebuilt frequently. The general idea is that these containers are all rebuilt nightly to keep the software within them up-to-date.

Containers under the `toolbox` directory are for use with [Toolbx](https://github.com/containers/toolbx).
